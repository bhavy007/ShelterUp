# ShelterUp
### Project Made By Team Puneet SuperStar

This Project Comprises of a user friendly platform for the generous donors and selfless social workers and NGOs who are always out there working for the betterment of the much needed and suppressed underprivileged kids begging for surviving and making a living for themselves and for their loved ones Our problem aims to connect children in need of shelter to NGOs with the help of citizens, by involving and motivating them to contribute to a greater social good by introducing a platform which is easily accessible. Through our platform, any registered user can share the details like name, last location of homeless children that they spot around themselves and upload it on our website. This information can then be accessed by verified NGOs who can provide shelter to those in need. Our platform also aims to improve the network and communication channels of NGOs. On visiting NGOs around us we discovered that NGOs use unorganised modes of communication to reach out to the community like WhatsApp groups etc. This platform not only provides a widely available, organised and central mode for communication but also greatly reduces the outreach workload for these organisations.
